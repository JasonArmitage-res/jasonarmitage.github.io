<a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3340531.3412783">In this research</a>, we propose a multimodal and multilingual resource that is designed to evaluate the strengths of multitask learning systems. 

Four contributions are presented:
* Multiple Languages and Modalities (MLM) - a dataset consisting of text in three languages (EN, FR, DE), images, location data, and triple classes.
* A generation process that provides a consistent and reproducible approach to build a
resource of diverse data with semantic relationships.
* Specification of a novel benchmark task to evaluate multitask systems consisting of cross-modal retrieval and location estimation.
* Multitask IR+LE framework - a multitask system that
combines several methods to perform in concurrence cross-modal retrieval and location estimation on highly diverse
data.

The MLM resource consists of data on 236k human settlements with text summaries, images, coordinates, and triples for each entity. This is used for a novel benchmark task that is designed to evaluate the ability of multitask systems to generalise on diverse data.

We build on an approach for learning from cross-modal data by <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1109/TPAMI.2019.2927476">Marin et al</a> and implement a framework that retrieves visual and textual inputs for geographic entities ahead of location estimation:
